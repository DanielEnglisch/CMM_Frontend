# C-- Language

 A simple non-object-oriented language with various data-types and predefined procedures. I developed the frontend of the compiler which includes Scanner and Parser as well as a AST-Visualization tool. For generating the Scanner and Parser from a grammar file, Coco/R was used. The backend was developed by Juergen Kerbl using the Truffle Framework. The whole project was implemented in Java using Eclipse IDE.
